# wedding-app
A wedding app made with Express

### Goals for this project:
- Build an app that uses express on the backend
- Use Passport to register users and log them in
- Learn MongoDB and Mongoose on the backend (Schemas etc)
- Create a working protoype that could be used in the real world
- Include various API's in the App

## Overview
The idea behind the project is to put all the things that I have learned during the past few months together and create a working protype of an app that could be used in the real world. 
The main technoligies I am trying to utilise are express on the backend, Google APIS(for both logging in and location search), MongoDB in order to store user data.
